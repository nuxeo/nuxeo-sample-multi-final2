# Nuxeo Sample for Multiple Projects

This plugin aim to show how to build and structure a sample project relying on multiple projects (including Studio
projects).

[Continuous Integration](https://jenkins.platform.dev.nuxeo.com/job/nuxeo/job/nuxeo-sample-multi-projects/)

## Code Structure

The "final2" project relies on both "common" and "vertical" projects.

Its package embeds/holds all dependencies needed for installation so it does not declare the common or vertical package
as dependencies.

Note that the correspondoing common and vertical packages are needed to be referenced in the studio project application
definition.
